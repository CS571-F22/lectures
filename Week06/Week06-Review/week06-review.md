### Overview
This class is split into 2 sections...
 1. How do we make user interfaces *usable*? How do we study our users? How do design, and how do we evaluate these designs?
 2. How do we *build* such user interfaces using practical tools like JavaScript and React (Web), React Native (Mobile), and DialogFlow (Voice)?
